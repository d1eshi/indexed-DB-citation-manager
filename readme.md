# Indexed DB Citation Manager

Hi, this is a project realized in course [JavaScript Moderno Gu√≠a Definitiva Construye +15 Proyectos](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-moderno-guia-definitiva-construye-10-proyectos/). The goal of this project is to give the user in this case the administration of a veterinarian, to save appointments, edit them and delete them.

## Technologies

I have used basic **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript**. Most of the styles are made in **Bootstrap**.

### Javascript

In **JavaSctip** we use **Indexed DB** as the main utility, so in this way we can save in a real small scale _database_ the appointments that a*re added and improve the user experience.*
We create two **Classes**, _Citations_ and _UI_, to instantiate it in many ways so _we can create a clean, non-repetitive code._
As a secondary utility we do the _validation of the data_, to avoid errors in the operation, and give the user a _better experience_ to not deal with **data corruption**, and to be able to keep a continuous database, _to improve it, and provide maintenance in the future._
